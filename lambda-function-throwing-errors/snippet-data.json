      "This snippet creates a Lambda function in Node.js that has a percentage chance of throwing an error. The code uses a Lambda environment variable called CHANCE_OF_FAILURE, which is a value between 0 and 100. If this environment variable is not present, it defaults to 50 (a 50% chance of throwing an error).",
      "This function can be useful for testing failure modes and retry behaviors when consuming events from upstream services."
